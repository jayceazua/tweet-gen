# Tweet Generator


#### Notes:
"You're gonna do it in parts, step-by-step. You'll start by making a Python script that can randomly generate words from a dictionary. Then you'll iteratively build a more complex Markov language model that you can stochastically sample to generate approximately grammatical sentences. To learn a basic grammar, you'll need to collect a large set of documents and parse their text to learn relationships between words. You'll also implement your own data structures including linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, and heaps to better understand their inner workings and performance tradeoffs. Throughout development, you'll regularly deploy updates of your improved language model to your Flask web server on Heroku. When you're satisfied, you'll connect it to Twitter to let users tweet their favorite results."
